DETECTED FINDINGS:
----------------------------------------

• Atelectasis: 82.0% (High confidence)

• Effusion: 71.0% (Moderate confidence)

KNOWLEDGE BASE CONTEXT:
----------------------------------------

[Citation 1]
  DISEASE: Atelectasis
  DEFINITION: Atelectasis is the collapse or incomplete expansion of the lung or a portion of the lung. It occurs when the tiny air sacs (alveoli) within the lung become deflated.
  RADIOLOGICAL FINDINGS: Appears as increased opacity, volume loss, displacement of fissures, mediastinal shift toward the affected side.

[Citation 2]
  DISEASE: Effusion
  DEFINITION: Pleural effusion is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space between the lung and chest wall.
  RADIOLOGICAL FINDINGS: Blunting of costophrenic angles, meniscus sign, homogeneous opacity at lung base.

[Citation 3]
  DISEASE: Edema
